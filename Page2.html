   <h3>› Thinking Aloud</h3>
   <p>The Thinking Aloud Method is one of the cheapest and simplest usability testing methods. The basic idea is to give users a task to perform, and ask the them to say out loud what they are thinking while performing the task.&nbsp;The Thinking Aloud Method was first introduced by Clayton Lewis in 1982 as a usability testing method for cognitive interface design. </p>

     <h4>Guidelines</h4>
     </li>
      <ul type="square">
     <li>
       <p>Gather a number of intended users.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
     <p>Give them a set of tasks to perform.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>Explain to them the Thinking Aloud methodology and that they need to say out loud their thoughts while performing each task. Explain to them that they can ask questions but that you can only answer them after the test is over. Give them examples of things you are looking for such as things that make them confuse.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>Make sure that they understand that the purpose of the test is to test the user interface and not the user. This is extremely important because some users may feel pressured to accomplish the task and may tend to hide some issues they are struggling with in order not to look naïve. </p>
     </li> 
     <li>
       <p>You can record the test if you would like, but you can simply just take notes while users are performing the test. However, it is important to make sure that users are aware of the type of recording and that they feel comfortable with that being used.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>It is important not to ask users questions that would interfere with the results. For example, you should not ask the user questions like “Did you not see the button over here?” such questions may tern their focus into things they may not otherwise noticed.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>While it is important not to interfere as much as possible, you may sometimes need to proved a little guidance when you the user stuck with something and they seem not be able to progress any more. 8. When users stop saying what they think about out loud, you should encourage the users to talk without saying things that can change the way the perform the task. Examples of things you could say to encourage users to talk are “Keep on saying what you are thinking”, “what’s confusing you?”, “what are you trying to do?”, etc. </p>
