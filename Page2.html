   <h3>› Thinking Aloud</h3>
   <p>The Thinking Aloud Method is one of the cheapest and simplest usability testing methods. The basic idea is to give users a task to perform, and ask the them to say out loud what they are thinking while performing the task.&nbsp;The Thinking Aloud Method was first introduced by Clayton Lewis in 1982 as a usability testing method for cognitive interface design. </p>
   <ul>
   <li>
  
     <h4>Guidelines</h4>
     </li>
      <ul type="square">
     <li>
       <p>Gather a number of intended users.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
     <p>Give them a set of tasks to perform.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>Explain to them the Thinking Aloud methodology and that they need to say out loud their thoughts while performing each task. Explain to them that they can ask questions but that you can only answer them after the test is over. Give them examples of things you are looking for such as things that make them confuse.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>Make sure they understand that the purpose of the test is to test the user interface and not the users themselves. This is extremely important because some users may feel pressured to accomplish the task and may tend to hide some issues they are struggling with in order not to look naïve. </p>
     </li> 
     <li>
       <p>You can record the test if you would like, but you can also just simply take notes while users are performing the test. However, it is important to make sure that users are aware of the type of recording you are using and that they are comfortable with that being used.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>It is important not to ask users questions that would interfere with the results. For example, you should not ask the user questions like “Did you not see the button over here?” such questions may turn their focus into things they may not otherwise have noticed.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>While it is important not to interfere as much as possible, you may sometimes need to provide some guidance when users are stuck with something and they seem not be able to progress any more.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>When users stop saying what they think about out loud, you should encourage them to talk without saying things that can change the way the perform the task. Examples of things you could say to encourage users to talk are “Keep on saying what you are thinking of”, “what’s confusing you right now?”, “what are you trying to do?”, etc. </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
    
     <li>
       <h4>Example </h4>
       <p>This is an example that is directly taken from <strong><a href="http://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-5.html#5-5">Lewis and Rieman (1993), <em>Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction </em></a></strong>that shows how the Thinking Aloud Method can be extremely helpful in discovering user interface issues that may not be otherwise discovered using other usability testing methods. </p>
       <blockquote> <p>One of Clayton's favorite examples of a thinking-aloud datum is from a test of an administrative workstation for law offices. This was a carefully designed, entirely menu-driven system intended for use by people without previous computing experience. The word "parameter" was used extensively in the documentation and in system messages to refer to a quantity that could take on various user-assigned values. Test users read this word as "perimeter", a telling sign that the designers had stepped outside the vocabulary that was meaningful to their users. </p></blockquote>
    
     </li>

     <h4>Advantages </h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
       <p>It is Simple and Cheap. The Thinking Aloud Method is quite simple. All the work is done by users, you just need to observe and take notes! The Thinking Aloud Method is also cheap to apply. No special tools or programs need be used. </p>
     </li>
       <li>
         <p>One of the best methods to discover major usability issues. a study conducted by Smilowitz (1994) showed that the Thinking Aloud Method is better than “take-home questionnaire” in discovering major usability issues. Moreover, problems with UI terms, as shown previously by Clayton’s example, may not be discovered if other usability testing methods were used. </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The Thinking Aloud Method has been proven to be effective. A number of studies were conducted that proved the effectiveness of the Thinking Aloud Method. If you would like to take a look at a summary of these studies, you can check <a href="https://calebjc.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/litreviewthinkaloud1999.pdf">this article</a>, under the section of “Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Think Aloud Method.” </p>
       </li>
         <li>
           <p>The Thinking Aloud Method is flexible. It can be applied at early stages of the development life cycle. You do not need to have a fully implemented UI; it can be done perfectly on a paper prototype. Also, The Thinking Aloud Method can be done to test any type of product with a UI such as mobile apps, websites, smartphone screens, etc. </p></li>
           <li>
           <p>The Thinking Aloud Method is easy to learn. The Thinking Aloud Method has a simple concept that in fact can be learned in a day! However, although the Thinking Aloud Method has a simple concept, some developers may not apply it in the correct way; some developers may interfere a lot and spoon mouth the users what developers want to hear, which will lead to inaccurate results. </p>
           
        
         </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
     <h4>Disadvantages </h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
       <p>Users may not feel comfortable thinking out loud. At first, users may find it weird to talk to themselves and may not really express their thoughts loudly. However, most users will quickly adapt to the method especially with the help of developers trying to urge them to talk and asking them to keep talking. </p>
     </li>
     
     <li>
       <p>Users want to look clever and may not state their true thoughts. Sometimes, if users are having trouble getting through something that appears to be simple, they might try to hide the difficulties they are having in order not to appear naïve. </p>
     </li>
     
     <li>
       <p>Developers may find it hard not to interfere when they should not be interfering. Sometimes developers will feel tempted to interfere and might throw in some comments to help users get around the UI that could have significant effects on the usability test results. If you had to interfere, you should make note of where you had to interfere and what exactly you helped the user with. </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>The Thinking Aloud Method can’t capture all UI issues, therefore, it should not be used alone. You should plan to use The Thinking Aloud method as a supplement usability testing method, not as the main usability testing method for your system. </p>
       </li>
     
     </ul>
   </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Further Reading</h4>
      <p>If you would like to learn more about The Thinking Aloud Method and see more examples on how it is used and how the collected data can be used, I would recommend reading Lewis and Rieman (1993) Sec. 5.5 of their free online book Task-Centered User Interface Design. </p>
