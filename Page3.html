   <h3>› Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>
   <p>The cognitive walkthrough is a usability inspection method that does not require users and can be done in early UI development stages. The cognitive walkthrough requires having a set of tasks that the UI support, description of the UI or mockup, and intended users background. Once all these three elements are available, UI evaluators/designers “walkthrough” each task while reasoning whether or not each step required to perform the task can be easily recognized and done by the user. </p>
   <p>The cognitive walkthrough was developed by Clayton Lewis, Peter Polson, Cathleen Wharton, and John Rieman in 1992. If you would like to learn about the theory behind the methodology, you can do so by reading <a href="cognitive walkthroughs a method for theory-based evaluation of user interfaces">Cognitive Walkthroughs: A Method for Theory-Based Evaluation of User Interfaces by Ploson et al. </a></p>
   <ul>
   <li>
     <h4>Guidelines </h4>
     
     <ul   type="disc">
     <li>
       <p>The cognitive walkthrough is designed to predict usability issues that users might encounter when they first interact with the UI, i.e. without training. </p>
     </li>
     
         <li>
           <p>The cognitive walkthrough should be done before implementing the UI, as <a href="http://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-4.html#4-1-1">Lewis and Rieman</a> state, “the walkthrough is really a tool for developing the interface, not for validating it.” </p>
         </li>
           <li>
             <p>the cognitive walkthrough can be done effectively on a detailed written description of a UI as it would on a working prototype. In fact, when the cognitive walkthrough is done on a written description of a UI, it can detect flaws in the UI documentation such as missing description of some UI components. </p>
           </li>  
     </ul>
     </li>
     
     
     <li>
       <h4>Before doing the walkthrough</h4>
       <p>Before performing a cognitive walkthrough, you need to have the following: </p>
       <ul   type="disc">
     <li>
       <p>A detailed description of the UI or a prototype. The prototype does not need to be computerized, it can be a paper-based prototype.</p>
     </li>
       
        <li>
          <p>Well defined tasks that the UI support. You do not need to do a cognitive walkthrough for every task that the system support. However, it is important to carefully select the tasks that will be tested in a way that cover almost every feature of the UI. </p>
        </li>
       
       
       <li>
         <p>Well defined sequence of steps (actions) for each task that are needed to complete the task using the UI. </p>
       </li>
       
       <li>
         <p>A definition of the UI users including their background and previous knowledge or experience on specific areas that could affect the way they use the UI. </p>
       </li>
       
       
       </ul>
     </li>
     
     
     
     <li>
       <h4>Walking through the tasks </h4>
       <p>After having all the requirements described in the previous section, a group of UI evaluators or designers gather around to tell a convincing story on how users will accomplish each task by walking through each step (action) while reasoning on whether or not it would be obvious for the user to do each step. UI evaluaters should critique the story to make it sound and convincing. <a href="http://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-4.html#4-1-1">Lewis and Rieman</a> suggest asking the following questions while walking through each action. </p>
       <blockquote>    
       <p>1. Will users be trying to produce whatever effect the action has?</p>
       <p>2. Will users see the control (button, menu, switch, etc.) for the action?</p>
       <p>3. Once users find the control, will they recognize that it produces the effect they want?</p>
       <p>4. After the action is taken, will users understand the feedback they get, so they can go on to the next action with confidence?</p>
   </blockquote>

        <h4>Advantages </h4>
        
        <ul   type="disc">
     <li>
       <p>It does not require actual users to do the cognitive walkthrough, which can save a lot of time. </p>
     </li>
       
        <li>
          <p>It can be done on early design stages and dose not need special tools to perform the  cognitive walkthrough. </p>
        </li>
       
       
       <li>
         <p>The cognitive walkthrough is simple and easy to learn and master. </p>
       </li>
       
       <li>
         <p>It can can best detect usability problems related to first-time users of a system. </p>
       </li>
       
       </ul>
    </li>
     
      <li>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul   type="disc">
     <li>
       <p>It might take a long time to perform the cognitive walkthrough on complex tasks. </p>
     </li>
       
        <li>
          <p>The efficiency of the cognitive walkthrough depends on the judgment of the UI evaluator(s). If his/her judgment is not reliable, then the results could be misleading. </p>
        </li>
       
       </ul>
      </li>
