   <h3>› Introduction</h3>
   <p>Usability evaluation is a term that refers to the process of evaluating the user interface to make sure that it is efficient, usable and, easy to use by users. There are two main types of usability evaluation: usability testing with real users and usability inspection by experienced designers. The former refers to the process of testing the user interface with real users in order to get accurate results/feedback on how well the users will use the system. On the other hand, usability inspection refers to the process of evaluating the user interface by experienced designers in order to find some usability issues. Usability inspection does not involve real users, therefore, it can’t be used as the main method of evaluating the user interface, but it can be extremely beneficiary for user interface design especially if done before implementing the user interface. </p>
   <p>There are many different methods of usability testing, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Examples of usability testing methods include, but not limited to, Benchmark Testing, Remote Usability Testing, Thinking Aloud, etc. Examples of usability evaluation methods include Cognitive Walkthrough, Heuristic Evaluation, Persona-Based Inspection, etc. Both usability testing and usability inspections are used to measure the following factors of the the user interface: </p>
   <ul>
   <li>
     <p>Ease of learning: how fast and easy users who have never used the user interface can accomplish tasks. </p>
     </li>
     <li> 
     <p>Efficiency: how fast users who are familiar with the user interface can accomplish tasks. </p>
     </li>
     
       <li>
         <p>Memorability: how much user memory is required to navigate through the system, the less the better. </p>
       </li>
     
       <li>
         <p>Error frequency: how much errors uses make while using the system?; how can they recover from these errors? What error messages are provided to them? Are these messages readable? etc.</p>
  
       </li>
     
   </ul>
   <p>In this presentation I will discuss in detail two usability evaluation methods. The first one is the Thinking Aloud Method, a usability testing methods, and the other one is the Cognitive Walkthrough, a usability inspection method. </p>
